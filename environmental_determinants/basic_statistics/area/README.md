# Area Data

The city area data is collected from [ONS Geography: Major Towns and Cities](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/ons::major-towns-and-cities-december-2015-boundaries-v2/about), and MSOA area is collected from [ONS Geography: MSOA Boundaries](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/ons::middle-layer-super-output-areas-december-2011-boundaries-generalised-clipped-bgc-ew-v3/about). They are the offical defination of city and MSOA boundaries, which contain the area size information.

The original unit of area is the square meter, and we provide square kilometer in our dataset.
