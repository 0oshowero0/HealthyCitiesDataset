# Mental Prescribing Data

This data is collected from [English Prescribing Dataset (EPD)](https://opendata.nhsbsa.net/dataset/english-prescribing-data-epd), which contains information on prescriptions issued in England that have been dispensed in England, Wales, Scotland, Guernsey, Alderney, Jersey, and the Isle of Man.

Here we calculate the actual cost of mental health related drugs as an indicator. We filter the drugs according to the direction of [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/) and the [British National Formulary (BNF)](https://bnf.nice.org.uk/) and aggregate them to the selected cities, from 2019-01 to 2022-08 in monthly frequency.

The selected drugs are available in metadata.csv
